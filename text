// BREATHE IN APP //

1.AFTER CREATING KEYFRAMES TO TRANSFORM CIRCLE FROM 0 TO 360 DEG WE NEED TO ADD GROW AND SHRINK ANIMATIONS
2.WE WILL SCALE IT TO MAKE IT GROW WHICH WILL ADD DYNAMICLY IN JS
3.IN JS WE FIRST SELECT DOM ELEMENTS WE ARE GOING TO NEED
4.WE CREATE VARIABLE OF TOTAL TIME IT TAKES TO BREATHE THAN HOLD AND BREATH OUT
5.CALCULATE THE BREATH TIME TOTAL (TIME / 5) * 2;
6.HOLD TIME = TOTALTIME / 5;

7.CREATE FUNCTION BREATHANIMATION 
(we will set this with setTimeout()function, set it to breathTime and holdTime)
8.NOW WE JUST ADD AND REMOVE TEXT EVENTS WITH INNERTEXT
9.THEN WE DO EXPEND WITH A BREATH
(we add container shrink and grow which we styled in CSS)
